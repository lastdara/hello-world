# hello-world

Hi!

I'm Dara. I love learning and learning equalls change, so I love change and the only thing that you can change is yourself. 
So, one of the things that I enjoy the most is learning and experiencing the change that follows.
The change starts with me, but then spreads to my environment. 
I hope that some day I can make big changes, in the positive way, in the world.
I think there is good and bad in the world, but you can't say which is which for sure.
The only thing is to try to be on the good side and add to the good of the world.
